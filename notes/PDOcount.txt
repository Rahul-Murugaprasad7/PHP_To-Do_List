public PDOStatement::rowCount(): int


PDOStatement::rowCount() returns the number of rows affected by the last DELETE, INSERT, or UPDATE statement executed by the corresponding PDOStatement object.

For statements that produce result sets, such as SELECT, the behavior is undefined and can be different for each driver. 
Some databases may return the number of rows produced by that statement (e.g. MySQL in buffered mode),
 but this behaviour is not guaranteed for all databases and should not be relied on for portable applications.

Note:

This method returns "0" (zero) with the SQLite driver at all times, 
and with the PostgreSQL driver only when setting the PDO::ATTR_CURSOR statement attribute to PDO::CURSOR_SCROLL.
