PDO::ERRMODE_SILENT

Prior to PHP 8.0.0, this was the default mode. 
PDO will simply set the error code for you to inspect using the PDO::errorCode() and PDO::errorInfo() methods on both the statement and database objects; 
if the error resulted from a call on a statement object, you would invoke the PDOStatement::errorCode() or PDOStatement::errorInfo() method on that object. 
If the error resulted from a call on the database object, you would invoke those methods on the database object instead.

PDO::ERRMODE_WARNING

In addition to setting the error code,PDO will emit a traditional E_WARNING message.
  This setting is useful during debugging/testing, if you just want to see what problems occurred without interrupting the flow of the application.

PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION

As of PHP 8.0.0, this is the default mode. 
In addition to setting the error code, PDO will throw a PDOException and set its properties to reflect the error code and error information. 
This setting is also useful during debugging, as it will effectively "blow up" the script at the point of the error,
 very quickly pointing a finger at potential problem areas in your code (remember: transactions are automatically rolled back if the exception causes the script to terminate).
